# Spacewar-2D
Spaceship pvp local 2D game for 2 players made with Pygame

This was based on [this](https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners) project, but I made some changes:
- Remade all the code and commented on every part
- Solved the 'video system not initialized' error
- Fixed some errors with the map boundaries
- Added new sound effects, since the original ones were corrupted
- Changed it so it doesn't lag when the game ends
- Updated keys so that it can be played on Windows and macOS
- If both players die at the same time, there's a tie
- Other minor changes, like the font
